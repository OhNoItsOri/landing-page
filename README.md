Let us introduce you to Sanctuary. Hopefully the city you’ve been looking for. We don’t aim to be fancy or have all the gadgets and gizmos that other cities have, but what we do have is a dedicated community of storytellers who all strive for a common goal — to tell their story.

Sanctuary is a server built around the experiences and people of other cities in order to cater to the growing needs of people who wanted more substance in their role-play. We believe that story is king and that the experience is what drives activity.
